/// Brings Spaces into the persistent workspace: a file's Spaces
/// (`ImportSpaces`), imported Spaces a person reviewed
/// (`ImportReviewedSpaces`) or the Spaces a manual setup drafted
/// (`ApplyManualSetup`). The Spaces arrive in the stored format, as a JSON
/// array, and the choices about them are typed and name each Space by its
/// identity. An import is saved with its sync journal before it returns.
///
/// Folder and history records keep their identities unless another Space
/// already holds them, because those identities are global in sync. A Space,
/// profile or tab that collides with another takes a new identity: each
/// imported tab is published in `TabsImported` with the tab it came from, and
/// each of the workspace's own tabs that took a new identity as `TabCopied`.
/// The window `WindowId` shows the first Space the import brought or changed.
///
/// Refused with `PersistentWorkspaceRequired` for any other workspace,
/// `SpaceLocked` when it would change a locked Space, giving it tabs or
/// folders or another name or look, `InvalidImport` for Spaces or choices it
/// cannot read, `SpaceLimitReached` when the workspace would hold too many
/// Spaces, and `SpaceBeingDeleted` when a Space it names is going away. A
/// locked Space the import leaves as it was, such as one a review leaves out,
/// a draft left unchanged or one it only moves in the order, never refuses it.
