/// card it landed in.

/// A local `NSEvent` monitor is the only thing that can see a click web content
/// consumes, and it gets a point rather than a view. Frames are how that point
/// becomes a card. They are registered in a named coordinate space owned by the
/// split surface — not `.global` — because the monitor's `NSView` spans exactly
/// the view that declares that space, which makes the AppKit conversion of the
/// event location an identity rather than an assumption about where a window's
/// content view begins relative to its titlebar.
///
/// Deliberately not `@Observable`. Nothing renders from these frames; they are
/// written *during* layout and read only when a click arrives. Observation would
/// invalidate the view that just produced the frame it recorded.
///
/// Not on `BrowserStore` either: which cards are where is presentation state
/// belonging to one window's content area, and a second window presenting the
/// same group would fight over the same keys.
///
/// Work package 8 registers card frames again, in global coordinates, inside
/// `BrowserSidebarReorderState` — drag-drop resolution compares one pointer
/// against sidebar zones and cards together, which needs the shared global
/// space. The two registries coexist by design: same subject, different
/// coordinate space, different owner and lifetime.
