/// The live carry: which card is off the row, where the pointer has taken it,

/// One per window, owned by the window's root model, because a carry is a
/// property of the content area somebody is pointing at rather than of the
/// session. Two windows presenting the same group carry independently and
/// neither can see the other's gap.
///
/// The state answers *what* is being carried and never *where it may go*: the
/// slot arrives already resolved, from `BrowserSplitCardLiftPolicy` measuring
/// the pointer against the frames the row registered. Keeping resolution out
/// here is what lets the whole geometry be exercised without a carry, and the
/// whole carry be exercised without a window.
///
/// ## The whole state machine
///
/// A pickup is two steps, the same stage-then-promote contract the sidebar's
/// reorder uses, and for the same reason: the pickup has work to do — asking
/// WebKit for a picture — that must happen *before* anything changes on screen,
/// and that work needs an identity to belong to before the carry exists.

/// Every entry has a guaranteed exit and no state is duplicated anywhere else.
/// `isCarrying` is the single answer to "does the pointer belong to a carry", so
/// the event monitor asks rather than remembering — a monitor with its own copy
/// of that boolean is a monitor that can be left swallowing events for a carry
/// that has already ended, which is exactly how a window ends up unable to pick
/// anything up ever again.
///
/// A staged pickup holds nothing on screen and mutates nothing. Refusing one is
/// therefore free: `discard` returns the state to idle with no trace, and any
/// image the refused pickup asked for is refused on arrival because no carry
/// bears its token.
