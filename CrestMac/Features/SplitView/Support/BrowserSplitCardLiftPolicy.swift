    ///   are not cards.

    ///   point a few units inside a card's edge is both inside that card and
    ///   under the control that resizes it. The resize wins: it is the older
    ///   affordance and the one already under the pointer's own cursor.

    ///   exactly as they do for click-to-focus.

    /// Focus is deliberately absent from this list, and the omission is the
