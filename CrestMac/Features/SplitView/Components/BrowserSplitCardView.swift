/// One card of a macOS split: the per-card twin of `BrowserDetailView`.
///
/// Both resolve a page and a presentation and then hand the same
/// `BrowserDetailContent` the result, which is deliberate — the find bar, the
/// navigation-failure overlay, the credential chrome, and the developer toolbar
/// all live on `BrowserPage`, so a card that renders the same content view gets
/// every one of them for its own page with nothing per-card to maintain.
///
/// The difference is which tab it speaks for. `BrowserDetailView` speaks for the
/// selected tab; a card speaks for its own member, focused or not, and resolves
/// its page through the assignment-checked accessor so a Space switch mid-frame
/// can never bind a page belonging to another Space or profile.
///
/// Three things ride along that the single-page path has no need for:
///
/// - **Hover tracking**, as an AppKit tracking area rather than `.onHover`, which
///   is unreliable over live web content. Whether entering the card is worth a
///   focus change is `focusesOnHover`'s answer, evaluated at the moment the
///   pointer arrives so nothing here has to observe the preference or the address
///   field.
/// - **Frame registration**, twice over. The surface's own registry, in its named
///   space, is how a single mouse-down monitor turns a point into a card — a tap
///   gesture cannot replace it, because web content consumes the clicks that
///   matter. The reorder state's registry, in the global space, is how a drag
///   arriving from the sidebar knows which cards it is between.
/// - **`BrowserSplitCardLifecycleModifier`**, which keeps this member's tab row and
///   history current while some other card holds focus.
