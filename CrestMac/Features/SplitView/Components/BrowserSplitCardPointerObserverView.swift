import AppKit

/// Watches the window's pointer for the two things Split View does with one:
/// focus follows a click, and a ⇧⌘-held press picks a card up and carries it.
///
/// A `TapGesture` cannot do either. Web content consumes its own clicks, so a
/// gesture attached above a `WKWebView` never sees the click that focuses a card
/// — which is nearly every click somebody makes — and a `DragGesture` over the
/// page never begins at all. A local `NSEvent` monitor sees each event before
/// the window dispatches it, which is the one place both are still available.
///
/// One monitor per window, not one per card. Four cards would install four
/// monitors that all see the same event and all have to work out whether it was
/// theirs; the frame registry answers that question once.
///
/// The two jobs differ in exactly one way, and it is the important one. Focus is
/// a notification: the event is returned unmodified and the page still receives
/// it, so focus follows the click instead of costing one. A carry is a veto: the
/// press that picked the card up, every drag that moves it, the release that
/// puts it down, and the Escape that calls it off all belong to the carry, and
/// none of them reaches the page. Anything else would leave a text selection
/// smeared across the page somebody was only rearranging.
///
/// The view holds no state of its own — not even "am I carrying". That answer
/// lives in the lift state, which is the only thing that can know it: a carry
/// ends by release, by Escape, by right-click, by the window losing key, by the
/// card leaving the row, and by the row leaving the screen, and only some of
/// those pass through here. A remembered copy would survive the ones that do
/// not, and a monitor that wrongly believes it is carrying swallows every press
/// that follows — which is a window that can never pick anything up again.
///
/// The view is flipped and reports the event location in its own bounds, which is
/// what makes the geometry exact: SwiftUI registers card frames in a coordinate
/// space anchored on the very view this one spans, so `convert(_:from: nil)` on a
/// flipped view lands in the same space with no window-chrome arithmetic anywhere.
/// `hitTest` returns `nil` so the view itself is never a click target.
