import SwiftUI

/// Reports where one presented card sits, in the global space a drag resolves
/// in, so a tab dropped on the content area lands in the slot the pointer is
/// actually over.
///
/// Both content-area layouts register through this: a card of a split, and the
/// single surface a window presenting one tab draws instead. Treating the lone
/// surface as a card of its own is what makes the first drop — the one that
/// creates a split — the same arithmetic as every later one, and it is also how
/// a tab dragged onto the very tab it already shows is recognised and refused.
///
/// A `nil` tab registers nothing: a locked Space shows its access gate rather
/// than a page, and there is no card there to join. `assignment` is `nil` in the
/// same breath — both are read off the one presentation, so there is no card
/// without a Space presenting it.
///
/// The Space is registered alongside the frame because a card outlives the
/// presentation that put it there, and the content area shows one Space at a
/// time: switching Space leaves the Space just left still holding cards in the
/// registry, at the very rectangle the new one now occupies. What the drag makes
/// of that is `BrowserSidebarReorderState.SplitCard.space`.
///
/// Registration is owner-stamped because the two layouts swap places mid-drag
/// and SwiftUI runs the departing view's `onDisappear` after the arriving one
/// has measured itself. Without the stamp the exit would clear the entry the
/// entrance just made, the cards would read as empty, and the drop target would
/// vanish under the pointer.
