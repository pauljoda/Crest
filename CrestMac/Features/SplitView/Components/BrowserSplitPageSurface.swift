/// This is the split half of `BrowserRootPageSurface`'s branch: it composes the
/// shared columns layout with macOS cards and re-establishes, at row level, the
/// two things the single-surface path attaches to its one surface — the
/// utility-fan dismissal on web-content interaction, and the per-card decision
/// about a transparent interior that the start page depends on.
///
/// It also owns everything the pointer does to the row, because both of those
/// things are properties of the row rather than of any one card:
///
/// - **Focus.** One `BrowserSplitCardPointerMonitor` for the window. Cards
///   register their bounds in `cardFrames`, the monitor turns a mouse-down into
///   one of them, and the event continues to the page untouched. The hover path
///   is gated by the Follow Mouse preference and evaluated only when a pointer
///   actually arrives. Both funnel through `focusSplitCard`, which is an ordinary
///   selection change and no-ops on the card that already has focus, so the two
///   inputs can never fight.
/// - **The carry.** A ⇧⌘-held press picks a card up: the same monitor keeps the
///   events, the row draws that member's column as the gap wherever the pointer
///   has taken it, and the release commits the slot the gap is standing in.
///   Nothing is mutated until then — a carry that is cancelled leaves no trace
///   in the session at all.
