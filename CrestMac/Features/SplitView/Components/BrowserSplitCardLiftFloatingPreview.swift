/// a window pinned to the browser window's own bounds: placing the card by its
/// top-left inside that layer puts it exactly where the same card would have been
/// drawn in the row, in the same window-global coordinates the carry already
/// reports.
///
/// It is the card at its own size, risen by the house lift scale — not a token
/// standing in for one. A split card is half a window or more, so shrinking it
/// to a badge would have somebody rearranging something other than what they
/// picked up; at full size the neighbours are still visible around it, settling
/// into the order the release will keep.
///
/// The rise is scaled about the grabbed point rather than the card's centre,
/// which is what keeps the exact pixel somebody grabbed under the cursor. Only
/// the shape and the picture animate: animating the position as well would make
/// the card lag the pointer, which is the one thing a carry must never do.
