// The three places where an engine contributes its own site-scoped content to
// a shared surface: the Site Settings permission list, the Site Controls
// popover, and the top of a Space's sidebar. The presentation layer composes
// these names and never mentions an engine's types; each engine's module
// supplies its own implementation of them. The declarations below are the
// WebKit composition — the Chromium framework has its own file, and neither is
// compiled into the other's target: the Chromium framework excludes this file
// in project.yml.

/// Crest's own per-site permission list. WebKit has no permission UI of its
/// own, so the decisions come from Crest's permission centre; each open page's
/// `BrowserPageSitePermissionSession` carries a change to the page at once.
