/// Owns the transparent child window everything travelling on the pointer is
/// drawn in — a lifted sidebar row, a carried Split View card — for as long as it
/// is travelling.
///
/// A child window rather than an overlay view, because the thing it has to beat
/// is not a SwiftUI sibling. The page is a `WKWebView`, an `NSView` subtree
/// inside the same hosting view, and AppKit composites view subtrees above
/// everything SwiftUI draws in that host regardless of `zIndex`. Ordering is
/// only decided in SwiftUI's favour one level up, between windows: a child
/// window ordered above its parent paints above the parent's entire content,
/// web views included. It is also what AppKit's own dragging session used before
/// this release replaced it, for exactly this reason.
///
/// It takes the preview at the lift rather than at the page boundary. Handing a
/// travelling preview between two hosts leaves it clipped everywhere it is drawn
/// by the losing one — not only over the page, but by window chrome, by the
/// insets around the content area, and by whatever a view transition is passing
/// through at that moment. One owner for the whole lift has no such seam.
///
/// The window is inert. It ignores mouse events, never becomes key, casts no
/// shadow, and is pinned to the parent's content rect so that a point in the
/// drag's global coordinates is the same point inside it. Clicks, scrolls, and
/// hovers reach the page underneath as if it were not there.
///
/// This view is the drag's presentation and nothing else: it holds no drag state
/// and makes no decisions about when a lift floats. The reorder state answers
/// that, SwiftUI hands the answer down, and this view puts a window around it.
