# Crest roadmap

This file contains only work that is still outstanding or intentionally deferred.

## Approval-gated capabilities

- Obtain Apple's managed default-browser entitlement for `com.pauldavis.crest`, then enable and validate default-browser registration on physical devices.
- Complete the browser passkey entitlement request and physical-device passkey validation before advertising passkey-provider support.

## Release gates

- Deploy and verify the production CloudKit schema.
- Complete two-device convergence testing for Space lifecycle, secure deletion, Keychain behavior, and offline edits.
- Exercise camera, microphone, document picker, picture-in-picture, and offline recovery on physical iPhone and iPad hardware.
- Finish physical accessibility coverage for VoiceOver, Voice Control, keyboard-only use, pointer interaction, larger text, reduced motion, and right-to-left localization.
- Validate Stage Manager and external-display behavior on iPad.
- Run the real-world migration corpus for bookmarks, tabs, folders, and portable archives from supported source browsers.

## Active platform work

- Extension work is active on macOS. Preserve per-Space isolation, prefer Safari Web Extension app bundles where native integration is required, and report WebKit compatibility limits instead of presenting partially initialized extension UI as working.
