/// unavailable there and its menu item is absent. What a person actually reaches
/// for from a page context menu — "translate this passage" — is available, and it
/// is Apple's on-device translation either way: the same system service, the same
/// language downloads, and nothing sent to a translation server.
///
/// The presentation is anchored to a one-point view added to the key window, which
/// is what Apple's translation presentation wants and what lets the popover follow
/// the window it belongs to. Nothing is retained after it closes.
