# Troubleshoot an extension

Extensions run on Chromium, so most behave as they do in Chrome. When one doesn't, the cause is usually its Space, its site access, or a browser feature Crest draws differently from Chrome.

## Try these first

1. Check that you are in the Space where you installed it. Each Space has its own installations. See [Spaces and profile isolation](../spaces/spaces-and-isolation.md).
2. In **Crest Settings → Extensions**, choose the Space, then turn the extension off and back on.
3. Expand its row, select **Manage Permissions in Chromium**, and check whether its site access covers the page you are on.
4. Open **Extension Settings** if the extension has them, and check its own options.
5. Remove the extension and install it again from the Chrome Web Store.

## Read the error

Choose **Manage Extension…** from the extension's action menu to open Chromium's extension manager. It lists errors the extension reported. See [Check an extension's status and details](./status-and-technical-details.md).

## In a private window

Private windows run only the extensions you allow there. Allow the extension in private windows from Chromium's extension manager.

## Password managers and companion apps

If the extension needs a Mac app, such as 1Password or iCloud Passwords, the app decides whether to trust Crest. Use the signed and notarized Crest release, not a development build. See [Native companions](./native-companion-limits.md).

## Features Crest draws differently

Crest shows popups, side panels, extension windows and keyboard shortcuts in its own interface. An extension that expects part of Chrome's window that Crest does not draw may lose that feature. See [Extension compatibility](./api-compatibility-matrix.md).
