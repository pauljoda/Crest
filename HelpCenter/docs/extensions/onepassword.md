# Set up 1Password in Crest

The 1Password Chrome Web Store extension runs in the Chromium build of Crest for Mac. To unlock and fill through the 1Password app, the app must trust Crest as a browser.

:::caution Use the signed Crest release
1Password checks the browser's code signature. Use the Developer ID signed and notarized Crest release installed in `/Applications`. A development build carries a different signature, and 1Password rejects it.
:::

## Before you begin

- Install and unlock **1Password for Mac**.
- Choose the Crest Space that should own the extension. Installations do not copy to another Space or device on their own.

## Install the extension

1. In Crest for Mac, open the 1Password page in the Chrome Web Store.
2. Select **Add to Crest**.
3. Review the package, its permissions and the destination Space in Crest's review sheet.
4. Select **Add Extension**, then **Done**.

## Authorize Crest in 1Password

1. Open and unlock **1Password for Mac**.
2. Select your account or collection at the top of the sidebar, then select **Settings**.
3. Select **Browser** in the sidebar.
4. Select **Add Browser**.
5. Choose **Crest** in `/Applications`.
6. Review 1Password's access prompt and select **Authorize**.

1Password warns that an additional browser can reach your saved information while 1Password is unlocked, so it can save and fill logins. Only authorize a Crest build you trust.

## If it does not connect

Reinstalling the extension does not change the signature 1Password checks. Confirm that you added the Crest app in `/Applications`, then see [Native companions](./native-companion-limits.md) and [Troubleshoot an extension](./troubleshoot-partial-compatibility.md).
