# Manage permissions and website access per Space

Every Space keeps its own extension installations, permissions and website access. Allowing a tool in Work does not grant it the same access in Personal or on another Mac.

## At installation

The install review lists the permission warnings Chromium reports for the extension. Where the extension allows it, turn on **Withhold website access until I grant it** so the extension reaches a site only after you allow it. See [Install from the Chrome Web Store](./install-chrome-web-store.md).

## Review access later

1. Open **Crest Settings → Extensions**.
2. Under **Space**, choose **Manage extensions for** and select the Space.
3. Expand the extension's row to see its **Permissions and Website Access**.

## Change website access

In the expanded row, select **Manage Permissions in Chromium**. Chromium's page for that extension opens in the same Space, where you can change its site access and other permissions. The change applies only to this Space's installation.

## Turn an extension off without removing it

Use the **Enabled** switch on the extension's row. The installation and its data in the Space stay put, ready for when you turn it back on.

## Remove it and its data

Expand the row, select **Remove Extension**, and confirm **Remove from _Space_**. Crest removes the extension and its data from that Space. Other Spaces are unchanged.

Private Spaces must be unlocked before Crest shows or changes their installed extensions.
