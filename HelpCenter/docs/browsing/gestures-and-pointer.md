# Gestures and pointer actions

Many Crest actions stay out of the permanent chrome. This is the practical map for touch, trackpad, mouse, and drag and drop.

## iPhone

- Swipe vertically on the address capsule to move between the page and tab viewer.
- Swipe horizontally on the compact toolbar to page between cards in Split View. Outside a split, this gesture intentionally does nothing.
- Swipe from the leading edge to reveal a collapsed sidebar.
- Swipe or scroll the Space picker to move between Spaces.
- Touch and hold tabs, folders, links, and Space controls for context actions.

## Mac and iPad

- Drag a Split View divider to resize its columns.
- Drag a sidebar tab onto the page to create or extend a Split View.
- Drag tabs and folders to reorder them, save them in folders, or move them when a destination is shown.
- Swipe or scroll over the Space picker to change Spaces.
- Use the normal two-finger Back and Forward gesture inside web content; WebKit owns the page-navigation gesture.

## Mouse and trackpad details on Mac

- Right-click a tab, folder, Space, or link for its contextual actions.
- Middle-click a current tab to close it.
- Middle-click a pinned or saved item to unload its live page while keeping the durable item.
- Double-click the saved-location indicator on a saved tab, or its pinned tile when applicable, to return to the saved home URL.
- Enable **Focus Follows Mouse in Split View** if moving the pointer between cards should move focus too.

## Dragging without losing work

Dragging changes organization, not the page’s identity. A tab moved into a folder becomes saved; a tab moved to another Space loads under that destination profile; a tab dropped onto a page joins its Split View. Watch the insertion target before releasing when folders are nested.
