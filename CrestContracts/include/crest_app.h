/* The typed application API. Intents, changes, rejections, queries and their
 * answers cross as the generated positional wire format; crest_contracts.h
 * names the tags and the schema fingerprint. Swift and the core always ship
 * in one build, so the wire has no versioning: creation checks the
 * fingerprint instead. Calls are synchronous and serialized per app.
 *
 * Every buffer the core returns was allocated by the core; release it with
 * crest_buffer_free. Statuses other than OK and REJECTED are caller or build
 * bugs: INVALID_MESSAGE (bytes that do not decode, or trailing bytes),
 * LIMIT_EXCEEDED (a message longer than its type's limit: 16 MiB, or one
 * stored session part, 64 MiB, for the intent that carries an installed
 * session), INVALID_HANDLE, VERSION_MISMATCH and INTERNAL_ERROR.
