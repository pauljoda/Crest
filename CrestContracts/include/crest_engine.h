/* The engine contract. An engine binding registers with an app, the core
 * hands it commands (CreatePage, ClosePage) and the binding reports what
 * happens to its pages (PageCreated, PageCreationFailed, PageClosed).
 * Registrations, commands and reports cross in the same generated wire format
 * as crest_app.h; crest_contracts.h names the EngineCommand and EngineEvent
 * tags and the engine contract's own fingerprint, which changes only when the
 * engine contract does.
 *
 * The core delivers commands in the order it issued them, never while it holds
 * a lock and never on the stack of the report that caused them: an intent or a
 * report that arrives while a command is being run only adds to the queue,
 * and the call already delivering runs it next. A command issued by
 * crest_app_dispatch has been delivered when the dispatch returns, unless the
 * dispatch itself runs inside a delivery.
