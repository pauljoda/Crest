/// session take a signed offset, where `-1` is one slot toward the run's head.
/// The cards themselves are an `HStack` in member order, which SwiftUI mirrors
/// under a right-to-left layout — so in Arabic the head member draws on the
/// *right*, and "move left" has to mean `+1`.
///
/// Resolving the physical direction at the input boundary and leaving order
/// semantics everywhere else is the same shape `BrowserSpaceSwipePolicy` uses to
/// turn a swipe into `BrowserSpaceSwipeDirection`. The arrow chords bound to
/// these commands follow the label rather than the order: ⇧⌘← moves the card to
/// the person's left in both layouts.
