/// Every control in the Look and Feel pane changes something here. The window
/// crop reads the border, the sidebar edge, the page corner, and the Space's
/// own atmosphere, while the sidebar inside it is the shipping one, so tab
/// scale, pin layout, corner radius, tab and folder appearance arrive without
/// this view knowing any of them by name.
///
/// Pinned beside the form, the crop fills whatever height it is given. At the
/// top of a card it takes a fixed height instead, so a compact pane still
/// scrolls like a form.
