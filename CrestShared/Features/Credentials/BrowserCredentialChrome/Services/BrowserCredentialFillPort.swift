/// The two shells reach different pages — one a pooled windowed page, the other
/// the compact shell's resident page — but a fill prompt only ever asks the same
/// four things, and both pages already answer them with identical signatures.
/// They live here as closures rather than behind a protocol, for the same reason
/// `BrowserFindPort`'s do: there is no third implementation to swap in, only two
/// concrete pages, each bound where its shell presents the chrome.
///
/// `spaceID` is carried rather than read back through the app's selection, for
/// the reason `BrowserCredentialPageState` states: a prompt must keep asking the
/// Space its form was submitted in, even after the person has selected another.
///
/// None of the closures carries an isolation annotation, exactly like
/// `BrowserSidebarNavigationPort`'s: annotating them `@MainActor` would also
/// make them `@Sendable`, which the plain function values a View hands over are
/// not. The struct itself is isolated instead.
