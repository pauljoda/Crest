/// The handful of places the two shells answer a utility action differently.
///
/// The guards, the retry flow, and the acknowledge and items plumbing are the
/// same on both sides and stay in `BrowserSidebarUtilityCoordinator`. What
/// differs is only where a page ends up: the windowed shell opens a tab in
/// place and hands finished files to Finder, while the compact shell routes a
/// URL through its navigation and hands files to the share sheet. Those arrive
/// here as closures rather than behind a protocol — there is no third shell to
/// swap in, only two bindings each platform makes in its own extension.
///
/// Every closure is called only after the coordinator has confirmed the caller
/// still owns the selected, unlocked Space, so none of them re-checks access.
/// None carries an isolation annotation, exactly like the
/// `BrowserUtilityListActions` they feed: the compact shell binds navigation
/// closures its sidebar View is holding, and those are plain function values.
