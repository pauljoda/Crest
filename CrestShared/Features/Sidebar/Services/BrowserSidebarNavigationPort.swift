/// Everything the sidebar's navigation controls need from the page layer, and
/// nothing else.
///
/// The two shells reach different things — one drives a pool of windowed pages
/// through a session, the other a single compact page through `MobilePageActions`
/// — but the back, forward, and reload controls only ever ask the same eleven
/// questions. Those live here as closures rather than behind a protocol, for the
/// same reason `BrowserSidebarPageAccess` does: there is no third implementation
/// to swap in, only two concrete surfaces each shell binds in its own
/// convenience initializer.
///
/// Every closure reads through its surface at call time rather than capturing a
/// snapshot, so Observation still tracks what the controls touched — the
/// disabled states in particular are read inside a view body and have to
/// invalidate when the page's history changes.
///
/// None of the closures carries an isolation annotation, exactly like
/// `BrowserSidebarUtilityPlatformActions`: annotating them `@MainActor` would
/// also make them `@Sendable`, which the plain function values a View hands over
/// are not. The struct itself is isolated instead.
