/// whatever it happens to be over: the page is a `WKWebView`, an `NSView`
/// subtree inside the same hosting view, and AppKit composites view subtrees
/// above everything SwiftUI draws beside them no matter what `zIndex` they are
/// given — but window chrome, insets, and the bands a view transition passes
/// through clip a travelling preview just as effectively. Handing the preview
/// over part-way through a drag only moves the seam. So the whole pointer-
/// chasing visual, for the whole lift, belongs to a host that paints above the
/// window: see the macOS drag preview window host. What stays in the sidebar is
/// the structure — the gap the lifted row leaves, the neighbours stepping aside,
/// the drop indicator.

/// produced it is still the only source of truth, and a host that renders this
