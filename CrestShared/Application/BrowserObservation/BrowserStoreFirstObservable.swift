/// An `@Observable` model that stores a value before announcing its change.
///
/// Observation announces a change before the new value is stored, and SwiftUI
/// can render during that announcement: when an earlier update from a
/// different transaction is still pending, it flushes that update on the spot.
/// A view rendered there reads the old value and consumes the change, so a
/// lone write that nothing redraws afterwards stays stale on screen — a
/// sidebar that will not close, a bar that will not open, an `onChange` that
/// never runs. State like that is kept in `@ObservationIgnored` storage and
/// published through ``publish(_:into:as:)``, so any such render reads the new
/// value.
///
/// The macro-generated `access(keyPath:)` and `withMutation(keyPath:_:)` of an
/// `@Observable` final class satisfy the requirements.
