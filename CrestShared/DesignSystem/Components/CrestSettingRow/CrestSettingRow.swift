/// settings reads as a table, and a toggle is always the switch the rest of
/// Crest uses rather than the checkbox a nested control would otherwise become.
///
/// The reset reserves a consistent slot beside the label. Showing or hiding it
/// never moves the control, and its larger hit target stays clear of the text.
